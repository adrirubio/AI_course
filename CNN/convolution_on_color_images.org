* Convolution On Color Images
  We know that images are 3-D objects
  But up until now we have seen only 2-D objects
 
** 3D Convolution in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
  3D convolution extends the principles of convolutional operations from 2D images to 3D volumetric data, crucial in areas like medical imaging, 3D modeling, and video processing.

**** 3D Data Representation
   - Data is represented in three dimensions: width, height, and depth.
   - Example: In 3D medical images, each voxel (3D pixel) represents data in a volume.

**** 3D Filters/Kernels
   - 3D filters, or cubes of weights, slide over the input data across its width, height, and depth.
   - These filters are analogous to 2D filters but extended to the third dimension.

**** Convolution Operation
   - The filter performs element-wise multiplication with the input volume at each position.
   - The results are summed up to produce a single value in the output volume.
   - This process repeats across the entire input volume.

**** Feature Extraction
   - Filters can extract various features (edges, textures, patterns) from 3D data.
   - This is similar to feature extraction in 2D but in a volumetric context.

**** Output
    - The output is a 3D volume where each feature corresponds to the filter's response at each input position.
