* What is convolution?
  - Filter/Kernels: In CNNs, convolution involves using a small matrix of numbers, known as a filter or kernel, which moves across an input image.
  - Operation: At each position, the convolution operation involves element-wise multiplication of the filter values with the original pixel values of the image. These products are summed up to get a single number. This process is repeated across the entire image.
  - Feature Extraction: Each filter is designed to detect specific features in the image, like edges, textures, or colors. When the filter passes over a part of the image that contains the feature it's designed to detect, the convolution operation produces a higher numerical value.
  - Output: The result of convolution is an output image, often called a feature map, which highlights the features that the filter is designed to detect.
