** CNN_architecture
   You can think of a CNN as a "feature transformer"
 
**** Pooling
     At a high level, pooling is downsampling
     Output a smaller image from a bigger image
     If input is 100x100, a pool size of 2 would yield 50x50รง

     There are two types of pooling
        - Max pooling
	- Average pooling

***** Max pooling
****** What is Max Pooling
   - A process that reduces the size of the feature maps by summarizing the presence of features in patches of the feature map.

****** How it Works
   - A window (typically 2x2) slides over the feature map.
   - At each position, the maximum value within the window is selected.
   - This results in a new, reduced-size feature map where each element is the maximum value of a patch from the original map.

****** Benefits
   - Reduces the computational cost by decreasing the number of parameters.
   - Helps in making the detection of features invariant to scale and orientation changes.
   - Minimizes the risk of overfitting by providing an abstracted form of the features.

****** Summary
  Max pooling is a crucial component in CNNs for efficient and effective feature learning and representation.

***** Average pooling
****** What is Average Pooling
   - A process that summarizes the features in a patch of the feature map by calculating their average.

****** How it Works
   - A window (typically 2x2 or 3x3) slides over the feature map.
   - At each position, it computes the average of the values within the window.
   - This results in a new feature map where each element is the average of a patch from the original map.

****** Benefits
   - Reduces the number of parameters, lowering the computational load.
   - Helps in extracting smooth and less noisy features.
   - Contributes to the model's ability to generalize by focusing on the overall presence of features rather than their specific location.

****** Summary
  Average pooling is an important component in CNNs for feature abstraction and dimensionality reduction.
