* What is convolution?
  - Filter/Kernels: In CNNs, convolution involves using a small matrix of numbers, known as a filter or kernel, which moves across an input image.
  - Operation: At each position, the convolution operation involves element-wise multiplication of the filter values with the original pixel values of the image. These products are summed up to get a single number. This process is repeated across the entire image.
  - Feature Extraction: Each filter is designed to detect specific features in the image, like edges, textures, or colors. When the filter passes over a part of the image that contains the feature it's designed to detect, the convolution operation produces a higher numerical value.
  - Output: The result of convolution is an output image, often called a feature map, which highlights the features that the filter is designed to detect.

** Modes
*** Purpose
   - Adjusts spatial dimensions of the output feature map.
   - Essential for determining information preservation, especially at edges.

*** Function
   - Dictates whether and how many extra pixels are added around input image borders.
   - Affects convolutional filter application areas, impacting size and content of feature maps.

*** Usage
   - Different modes are selected based on the network's needs and desired outcome.
   - Some modes maintain output size equal to input, suitable for certain network architectures.
   - Others reduce output size, focusing on key features and reducing computation.
   - Some can increase output size, emphasizing edge information.

*** Summary
  Padding modes offer flexibility in CNN design, allowing control over image processing and balance between central and edge feature focus.
