   You can think of a CNN as a "feature transformer"

**** Pooling
     At a high level, pooling is downsampling
     Output a smaller image from a bigger image
     If input is 100x100, a pool size of 2 would yield 50x50รง

     There are two types of pooling
        - Max pooling
	- Average pooling
