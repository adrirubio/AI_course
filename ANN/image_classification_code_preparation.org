* steps:
  - Load the data
    - MNIST dataset
    - 10 digits(0 - 9)
    - Already included in Pytorch
  - Build the model
    - Sequential dense layers ending with multiclass logistic regression
  - Train the model
    - batch gradient descent
  - Evaluate the model
  - Make predictions

* Step 1: Load the data:
  Inside the torchvision library (already installed on Colab) uses the
  famous MNIST dataset - standard machine learning benchmark of
  handwritten digits each image is 28 x 28 = 784 pixels (grayscale) 0
  = black, 255 = white
  
  #+BEGIN_SRC python
  # Loading the data
  test_dataset = torchvision.datasets.MNIST(
    root='.',
    train=_____,
    transform=tran
  #+END_SRC

* Step 3: Train the model:
  - The model has 60,000 samples and this is too big a number to fit
    into memory.
  Solution: Batch Gradient Desent
  
  Pytorch:
  
  #+BEGIN_SRC python
  # Batch Gradient Desent
  batch_size = 128
  train_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(dataset=train_dataset, 
                                             batch_size=batch_size, 
                                             shuffle=True)
  #Then:					     
  for it in range(n_epochs):
    train_loss = []
    for inputs, targets in train_loader:
  #+END_SRC

* Step 4/5: Evaluating and Making Predictions:
  - Can't evaluate the entire dataset at once
  - Use the data loader again

  #+BEGIN_SRC python
   Evaluating a batch
  n_correct = 0.
  n_total = 0.
  for inputs, targets in test_loader:
    # Forward pass
    outputs = model(inputs)
    ...
  test_acc = n_correct / n_total
  #+END_SRC
