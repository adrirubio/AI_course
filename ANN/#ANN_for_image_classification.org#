* Full Walkthrough
  We start by importing these libraries:
  
  #+BEGIN_SRC python
  import torch
  import torch.nn as nn
  import torchvision
  import torchvision.transforms as transforms
  import numpy as np
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  #+END_SRC
  
** The first step is to download the data
  
  - Train Data:
  
  #+BEGIN_SRC python
  train_dataset = torchvision.datasets.MNIST(
    # specify where to download the data, '.' means the current directory
    root='.',
    # indicates that this is the train dataset
    train=True,
    # converts the images into PyTorch tensors
    transform=transforms.ToTensor(),
    download=True)

  # see the training data:
  train_dataset.data
  #+END_SRC

  - Test Data:

  #+BEGIN_SRC python
  test_dataset = torchvision.datasets.MNIST(
    # specify where to download the data, '.' means the current directory
    root='.',
    # indicates that this is the test dataset by making train=False
    train=False,
    # converts the images into PyTorch tensors
    transform=transforms.ToTensor(),
    download=True)
  #+END_SRC  
    
  Note that nothing is downloaded because all the files were downloaded in the previous step
  
** Now it is time to build the model
   
   #+BEGIN_SRC python
   model = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(784, 128),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Linear(128, 10)
   )
   #+END_SRC
