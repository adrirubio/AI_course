* Forward Propagation
  A model is for making predictions

  We refer to this as "going in the forward direction"
  - input layer
  - hidden layer 1
  - hidden layer 2
  - output layer
** Nurons
   Each neuron is looking for different features.
   We can stack more layers of neurons.
   The neuron (linear model) is not very expresive.
* Examples of ANN
  - ANN for Image Classification
  - ANN for Regression
