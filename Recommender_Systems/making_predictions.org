*** How to make predictions
- In this notebook for the first time we actually make predictions using the model.

***** finding watched movies
This line gets all the movies that the user with new_user_id 1 has already watched. The result is stored in watched_movie_ids.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
# Suppose I want to find recommendations for user_id = 1
# First find all the movie_ids for movies they haven't yet watched
watched_movie_ids = df[df.new_user_id == 1].new_movie_id.values
#+END_SRC

***** finding unwatched movies
This line identifies movie IDs that the user hasn't watched yet. It does this by excluding the watched_movie_ids from all available movie IDs.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
potential_movie_ids = df[~df.new_movie_id.isin(watched_movie_ids)].new_movie_id.unique()
#+END_SRC

Printing the exact number of unwatched movies.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
potential_movie_ids.shape
len(set(potential_movie_ids))
#+END_SRC

***** preparing user ID's for recommendations

This creates an array of ones with the same length as potential_movie_ids.

#+BEGIN_SRC python
user_id_to_recommend = np.ones_like(potential_movie_ids)
#+END_SRC
