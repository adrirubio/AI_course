** Recommender Systems: Feature Concatenation
The user and movie feature matrices represent entities in a shared latent feature space with dimensionality 'D'.
Each row in the user matrix corresponds to a user's affinity towards 'D' latent features, while each row in the movie matrix represents 'D' latent features of a movie.

*** Concatenated Features for Prediction
To predict a user's preference for a particular movie, their feature vectors are concatenated, forming a new feature space with dimensionality '2D'. This allows a predictive model to learn interactions between user preferences and movie attributes.
