*** Recommender model
Here we will create a model that recommends movies, this model is very similar to the NLP text classification model.

*** imports
- Same imports as always except os, zipfile, urllib and cProfile which are used for downloading the data.
#+BEGIN_SRC python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from datetime import datetime
from sklearn.utils import shuffle
import os
import zipfile
import urllib.request
import cProfile
#+END_SRC

*** loading the data
- Now we load the data from the url:
  (Beware from now on the datasets get very bit)

#+BEGIN_SRC python
# Define the URL to download the MovieLens dataset
url = "http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-20m.zip"
filename = "ml-20m.zip"

# Check if the file already exists before downloading
if not os.path.exists(filename):
    # Download the file
    urllib.request.urlretrieve(url, filename)
    print("File downloaded successfully.")
else:
    print("File already exists.")

# Unzip the downloaded file
with zipfile.ZipFile(filename, 'r') as zip_ref:
    zip_ref.extractall("movielens_data")

data_dir = 'movielens_data/ml-20m/'
#+END_SRC

*** reading the CSV file
