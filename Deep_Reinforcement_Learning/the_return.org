*** The Return
In deep reinforcement learning, the return is a key concept that helps determine how successful an agent's actions are over time. Here’s a simple breakdown:

**** 1. What is the Return?
   - The return is the total amount of reward an agent collects from a certain point in time until the end of a task or episode.
   - Think of it as the sum of all the rewards the agent earns after taking a particular action until it finishes its current task.

**** 2. Discounted Return:
   - Sometimes, we value immediate rewards more than future rewards. To handle this, we use a method called discounting.
   - Discounting means that rewards received sooner are considered more valuable than those received later.
   - This helps in focusing on short-term gains while still considering long-term outcomes.

**** 3. Why is the Return Important?
   - The return is used to measure how good an agent’s actions or strategy is.
   - The goal in reinforcement learning is for the agent to learn to make decisions that maximize this return over time.

**** 4. Example:
   - Imagine an agent is learning to navigate a maze, and it gets points for finding the exit.
   - If the agent receives points at different stages, the return is the total points it accumulates from the starting point to finding the exit.
   - If the agent finds the exit quickly and collects more points early on, it’s considered to have a higher return.

By focusing on maximizing the return, reinforcement learning agents learn to perform tasks efficiently over time.
