*** Q-Learning and Deep Q-Learning

**** Introduction
   Deep Q-Learning is a type of reinforcement learning algorithm that combines Q-Learning with deep neural networks. This approach is particularly useful for handling environments with high-dimensional state spaces, such as video games.

**** Q-Learning
   Q-Learning is a value-based method of supplying information to tell an agent what action to take under what circumstances. It works by learning a Q-value function, Q(s, a), which estimates the value of taking action *a* in state *s*.

   - Q-Value (Quality Value): The expected future reward of an action taken in a given state.
   - Policy: A strategy used by the agent to determine the next action based on the current state.

**** Deep Q-Learning
   Deep Q-Learning extends Q-Learning by using a deep neural network to approximate the Q-value function. This allows the algorithm to handle complex state spaces, such as images.

   - Neural Network: Used to approximate the Q-value function. The input to the network is the state, and the output is the Q-value for each action.
   - Experience Replay: A technique where the agent stores its experiences (state, action, reward, next state) in a replay buffer and uses random samples from this buffer to train the network. This helps in breaking the correlation between consecutive samples and leads to better training stability.
   - Target Network: A copy of the Q-network used to compute target Q-values. The target network is updated less frequently, which stabilizes training.

**** Algorithm Steps
   1. Initialize Replay Memory: Store experiences.
   2. Initialize Q-Network: Create the neural network to predict Q-values.
   3. For each episode:
      - Initialize state.
      - For each step in the episode:
        - Select an action (exploration vs exploitation).
        - Perform the action and observe the reward and next state.
        - Store the experience in replay memory.
        - Sample a random batch from replay memory.
        - Compute the target Q-value.
        - Update the Q-network.
        - Update the state.
      - Decay the exploration rate.

**** Practical Applications
   Deep Q-Learning has been successfully applied to various domains, including:
   - Game playing (e.g., Atari games).
   - Robotics.
   - Autonomous driving.

**** Summary
   Deep Q-Learning is a powerful algorithm that combines the concepts of Q-Learning with deep neural networks, enabling agents to learn optimal policies in complex environments. By leveraging techniques like experience replay and target networks, it achieves stable and efficient learning thanks to Deep Q-Learning.
