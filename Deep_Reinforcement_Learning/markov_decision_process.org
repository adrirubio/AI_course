*** What is an MDP?
A Markov Decision Process (MDP) is a way to describe a situation where you make decisions that lead to different outcomes. It's used in reinforcement learning to help an agent (like a robot or computer program) learn how to make good decisions.

**** Parts of an MDP
An MDP has four main parts:
- States (S): All the possible situations the agent can be in.
- Actions (A): The choices the agent can make.
- Transition Function (T): The rules that tell us how we move from one state to another when an action is taken, represented as ( p(s'|s, a) ). This is the probability of transitioning to state
   \( s' \) from state \( s \) after taking action ( a ).
- Reward Function (R): The feedback the agent gets after moving to a new state.

**** The Goal
The agent's goal is to find a policy (a way of choosing actions) that gets the most reward over time.

**** How to Measure Success
- State-Value (V): How good it is to be in a particular state.
- Action-Value (Q): How good it is to take a specific action in a particular state.

**** Solving an MDP
To solve an MDP means finding the best policy. Common methods include:
- Value Iteration: Update value estimates until they stop changing.
- Policy Iteration: Alternate between improving the policy and updating value estimates.

**** Deep Reinforcement Learning
In deep reinforcement learning, we use neural networks to estimate V and Q, which helps the agent learn in complex situations.

**** Summary
MDPs are the basic framework for making decisions in reinforcement learning, helping agents learn the best actions to take to maximize their rewards.
