*** Epsilon-Greedy
**** Introduction
- The epsilon-greedy strategy is a simple and widely used algorithm in reinforcement learning for balancing exploration and exploitation.

**** Key Concepts
***** Exploration vs. Exploitation
- Exploration: Trying out new actions to discover their effects and potentially find more rewarding actions.
- Exploitation: Choosing the best-known action to maximize the immediate reward based on past experience.

***** Epsilon (ε)
- A parameter between 0 and 1 that determines the likelihood of exploration.
- Typically a small value like 0.1 or 0.2.

***** Action Selection
- With probability ε, choose a random action (exploration).
- With probability 1 - ε, choose the best-known action (exploitation).

**** Example
If ε = 0.1, then:
- 10% of the time, the agent will explore by choosing a random action.
- 90% of the time, the agent will exploit by choosing the action that currently has the highest estimated reward.

**** Advantages
- Simplicity: The epsilon-greedy strategy is straightforward to implement and understand.
- Effectiveness: Provides a basic but effective way to balance exploration and exploitation.

**** Disadvantages
- Fixed Exploration Rate: The exploration rate ε is constant, which may not be optimal throughout the learning process.

**** Summary
The epsilon-greedy strategy is a fundamental technique in reinforcement learning that helps an agent balance the trade-off between exploring new actions and exploiting known rewarding actions. By adjusting the parameter ε, one can control the degree of exploration and thus influence the learning process.
