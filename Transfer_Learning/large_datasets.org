*** Transfer Learning with Large Datasets
    Transfer learning involves using a pre-trained model on a large dataset to improve performance on a related task with a smaller dataset.
    Efficient memory management using batch processing is crucial when handling large datasets.

*** Steps to Use Batches in Training
** Loading the Data in Batches
   Load one batch at a time to manage memory efficiently. Use data generators or data loaders to load data on the fly instead of loading the entire dataset into memory.

** Data Generators
   Utilize data generators to yield batches of data dynamically during training. This approach ensures that only one batch is in memory at any given time.

** Data Loaders (PyTorch)
   Employ data loaders to handle batch processing. Data loaders can load data from disk as needed, keeping memory usage low.

** Training Loop
   Implement a training loop that iterates through the dataset batch by batch. This involves:
   - Initializing the model, loss function, and optimizer.
   - Training the model by iterating over batches from the data loader.
   - Updating the model's weights based on the loss computed for each batch.
   - Validating the model's performance on a separate validation dataset in batches.

*** Key Points to Remember
** Memory Efficiency
   Loading and processing one batch at a time ensures that only a small portion of the dataset is in memory, enabling efficient handling of large datasets.

** Batch Size
   Select a batch size that fits within your memory constraints. Batch sizes commonly range from 16 to 256, depending on model complexity and dataset size.

** Shuffle Data
   Shuffle the data at the beginning of each epoch to ensure the model generalizes well and does not memorize the data order.

** Steps per Epoch
   Define the number of batches to process in one epoch, calculated as the total number of samples divided by the batch size.

*** Benefits of Batch Processing in Transfer Learning
** Reduced Training Time
   Leveraging pre-trained models and batch processing reduces the overall training time compared to training from scratch.

** Improved Performance
   Transfer learning combined with batch processing often results in better performance, especially when the new task has a smaller dataset.

** Requires Less Data
   Effective use of pre-trained models and batches allows for robust model training even with limited data for the specific task.
