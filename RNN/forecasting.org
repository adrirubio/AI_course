** Forecasting 
  Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a class of neural networks that are particularly effective for sequence data like time series, making them suitable for forecasting tasks.
   
*** Overview
   - Description: RNNs are designed to process sequences by maintaining a 'memory' of previous inputs. This makes them ideal for tasks where the current output depends on previous elements in the sequence.
   - Applications: Used in stock market prediction, weather forecasting, demand forecasting in retail, etc.

*** Key Concepts
   - Sequence Data: Data where the order of inputs is significant.
   - Hidden State: The 'memory' of the network, updated at each step of the sequence.
   - Time Steps: Each individual point in the sequence.
   - Features: Data points at each time step, can be multidimensional.

*** Training the Model
   - Data Preprocessing: Normalize data, convert to sequences.
   - Loss Function: Typically Mean Squared Error for forecasting.
   - Optimization: Use algorithms like Adam or SGD.

*** Challenges in RNN Forecasting
   - Vanishing Gradient Problem: Can occur during training of deep RNNs, where gradients shrink and learning slows down or stops.
   - Overfitting: Especially in cases with noisy time series data.
   - **Data Preprocessing: Requires careful preparation of sequences and normalization.
