** Sequence data 
    Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are particularly well-suited for processing sequence data, where the order of elements is significant.
 
*** Examples
     
    - Natural Language Text
    - Time Series Data
    - Speech Recognition
    - Music Generation
    - Video Analysis
    - Handwriting Recognition
    - Biological Sequences
    - Language Translation
      
*** What is a Sequence?
  - A sequence is an ordered collection of elements.
  - The order of these elements is crucial to the meaning or function of the sequence.
  - Examples:
    + Numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4 (each number follows the previous in an ordered manner)
    + Letters: A, B, C, D (each letter is in alphabetical order)
    + Words in a sentence: The arrangement of words determines the sentence's meaning.
  - In computer science and mathematics, sequences are used to represent strings of text, lists of numbers, or other ordered data types.
