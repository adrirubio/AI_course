** RNN for time series prediction
   Most of the code in this notebook has been seen before in previous notebooks so will not be revised.

*** imports
    #+BEGIN_SRC python
    import torch
    import torch.nn as nn
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    #+END_SRC

*** make the original data
    #+BEGIN_SRC python
    This generates the time series data set and then plots it.
